# LinearRegressionImplementation

My own implementation of a base linear regression model and compared to the sklearn implementation with no hyperparameters specified. You will see that both models perform very similarly. main.py has the main body of code, load_data.py prepares the data, and multivariate_linear_regression.py contains my implementation of the linear regression algorithm with multiple dimensions.
